# 👋 Hello!
* Here is a 1.17 texture pack that brings some custom textures to Survival mode of the minecraft server [Void Realms](https://voidrealms.net/).
* This pack requires [Optifine](https://optifine.net/home) to work

# 📂 How to install?
* Click on code -> download ZIP from the home repository page
* put the zip in your ressource pack folder
* Select it
* And that's it, your textures should be customized

How your folders should be organized (you can remove the readme.md file)

# ❌ It doesn't work?
* Have you installed [Optifine](https://optifine.net/home)?
* have you well unziped the pack? (assets folder should be right in the folder you put on your ressource pack folder)
* Are custom items enabled? (video settings -> quality -> custom items -> ON)
* Is you minecraft version compatible with the texture pack?

# 🙏 Credits
* Thanks to everyone who helped me making the textures!
