# 👋 Hello!
* Here is a 1.16 texture pack that brings some custom slimefun textures to the minecraft server [Void Realms](https://voidrealms.net/).
* This pack requires [Optifine](https://optifine.net/home) to work

# 📂 How to install?
* Download the [lastest release](https://github.com/Astri2/Void-Realms-Slimefun-Resourcepack/releases) of the pack
* put the zip in your ressource pack folder
* Select it
* And that's it, your textures should be customized

How your folders should be organized (you can remove the readme.md file)

# ❌ It doesn't work?
* Have you installed [Optifine](https://optifine.net/home)?
* have you well unziped the pack? (assets folder should be right in the folder you put on your ressource pack folder)
* Are custom items enabled? _(video settings -> quality -> custom items -> ON)_
* Is you minecraft version compatible with the texture pack?

# 📚 Can you help?
* If you see any bug, please report it on [discord](https://discord.gg/a6RX9yPdJn). (some textures may not be implemented yet)
* If you want to suggest a new texture or a texture modification, please join the [discord](https://discord.gg/a6RX9yPdJn).

# 🔷 Other packs
### 🔹 We made a pack to display 1.17 textures if you are playing in 1.16 (only works in GUI)
* You can download it [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/861655481608699914/875875186174488616/1.17_textures_in_1.16.zip).
* It also requires [Optifine](https://optifine.net/home) to work.
* Once again if you experience any bug or have any suggestion, please join the discord!

### 🔹 We're planning to make a pack that gives tinkers items a modifier-dependent texture
* Sadly it is not functional enough to get released yet

# 🙏 Credits
* Some textures of the pack are from [RaulH22's texture pack](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/slimefun-texture-by-raulh22/).
* Huge Thanks to 16Bitboy#7819 and TinoMuk#7817 for helping me creating our own textures!
